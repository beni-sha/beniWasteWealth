    <p>WELCOME</p>
    <p>“WasteWealth is about turning everyday waste into something valuable. We help protect the environment, support communities, and create opportunities by giving a new purpose to what would normally be thrown away.”</p>
    <P>Many everyday items we throw away, like plastic bottles, paper, or food scraps, can be given a second life. By sorting and recycling waste properly, we reduce the amount of garbage that ends up in landfills and protect nature. This simple action helps keep our surroundings cleaner and healthier for everyone.</P>
    <p>By turning waste into wealth, we build a cleaner environment and stronger communities. Every small effort, like recycling or reusing, adds up to a big change. Together, we can make waste valuable and create a future that is both sustainable and full of opportunity.</p>
